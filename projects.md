Here is where I'll show some of the projects I've worked on.
A brief description of some of projects/repositories

## [pydoc.random](https://github.com/AaruranE/pydoc.random)
Generates artifical python 3 documentation, using GPT-2. Built a parallelized data pipeline using Go and to scrape all of the python docs and clean the data.
*Topics: golang; python; documentation; transformer methods; web scraping; data engineering

## [graph-nns](https://github.com/AaruranE/graph-nns)
Playing around with graph neural networks. Designed a parallel algorthm to train many models in parallel and cache them for robustness analysis.
*Topics: graph neural networks; python; pytorch; multiprocessing; t-sne; 

## [dp-roundtable](https://github.com/georgianpartners/dp-roundtable)
Differential privacy, explored and summarized for a previous internship. This repo includes a presentation I gave to some of the portfolio companies at Georgian Partners. Learn more about them [here](https://georgianpartners.com/)
*Topics: differential privacy; machine learning; stochastic gradient descent; research

## [gokart-analysis](https://github.com/AaruranE/gokart-analysis)
A few of my friends went go-karting together, and we were given a paper reporting our lap times. I analyzed this data to tell a story of how we all performed.
*Topics: python; data science; visualization; R; go-karts;

## [pytorch-vs-tensorflow](https://github.com/AaruranE/pytorch-vs-tensorflow)
A comparison of two popular machine learning frameworks. So far, I'm comparing an implementation of fastText between the two. 
Highlights of analysis will be found here, more in-depth details will be found at the link above.
*Topics: pytorch; fastText; python; keras; OOP; sentiment analysis; 

## [PlasmaPy](https://github.com/AaruranE/PlasmaPy) 
An open-source contribution I'm working on. I'm aiming to optimize some numerical solvers using Cython, or numba.
*Topics: plasma physics; cython; numba; open-source; python; benchmarking;*

## [Analogies](httpsL//github.com/AaruranE/Analogies)
A Flask app that leverages nltk's brown corpus to illustrate simple analogical reasoning.
*Topics: flask; nltk; gensim; python; word embeddings; natural language processing;*

## [PocketPlot](https://github.com/AaruranE/Machine-learning-self-study/PocketPlot)
A web app built with R's shiny package to quickly plot and analyze data from fixed-width files.
*Topics: R; shiny; plotly; dplyr; tidyr*

Here is where I'll show some of the projects I've worked on.

A brief description of some of projects/repositories

## [pytorch-vs-tensorflow](https://github.com/AaruranE/pytorch-vs-tensorflow)

A comparison of two popular machine learning frameworks. So far, I'm comparing an implementation of fastText between the two. 
Highlights of analysis will be found here, more in-depth details will be found at the link above.

*Topics: pytorch; fastText; python; keras; OOP;*

## [PlasmaPy](https://github.com/AaruranE/PlasmaPy)

An open-source contribution I'm working on. I'm aiming to optimize some numerical solvers using Cython, or numba.

*Topics: plasma physics; cython; numba; open-source; python; benchmarking;*


## [Analogies](httpsL//github.com/AaruranE/Analogies)

A Flask app that leverages nltk's brown corpus to illustrate simple analogical reasoning.

*Topics: flask; nltk; gensim; python; word embeddings; natural language processing;*

## [PocketPlot](https://github.com/AaruranE/Machine-learning-self-study/PocketPlot)

A web app built with R's shiny package to quickly plot and analyze data from fixed-width files.

*Topics: R; shiny; plotly; dplyr; tidyr*
